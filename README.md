### Greetins from Myanmar! :wave::heart:
Hi! I'm Phyo Thiha Kyaw aka Ted, a software developer currently based in Myanmar. Always love to chat and discuss about programming, software architectures, web development, games, pets and dogs. Looking for my luck to learn about internet-of-things, low-level programming, and complex business domains. Currently developing multi business units operational systems for [one of the biggest retail companies in Myanmar](https://cityholdings.com.mm/companies).
